## Contributing
The [Vercel REST API docs](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api) and [Raycast developer docs](https://developers.raycast.com/) are good places to start. Feel free to open an issue or [ping me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/max_leiter) if you want to help out.

This is a (heavily) modified fork of the [vercast](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/vercast) extension.
